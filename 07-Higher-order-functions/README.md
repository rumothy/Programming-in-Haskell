# 7 Higher-order functions

In this chapter we introduce higher-order functions, which allow common programming patterns to be encapsulated as functions. We start by explaining what higher-order functions are and why they are useful, then introduce a number of higher-order functions from the standard prelude, and conclude by implementing a binary string transmitter and two voting algorithms.
