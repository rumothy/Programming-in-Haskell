# Basic concepts

As we have seen in previous chapters, functions with multiple arguments are usually defined in Haskell using the notion of currying. That is, the arguments are taken one at a time by exploiting the fact that functions can return functions as results. For example, the definition

    add :: Int -> Int -> Int 
    add x y = x + y

means

    add :: Int -> Int -> Int
    add = \x -> (\y -> x + y)

and states that add is a function that takes an integer x and returns a function, which in turn takes another integer y and returns their sum x + y. In Haskell, it is also permissible to define functions that take functions as arguments. For example, a function that takes a function and a value, and returns the result of applygin the function twice to the value, can be defined as follows:

    twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> 
    twice f x = f (f x)

For example:

    > twice (*2) 3
    12

    > twice reverse [1, 2, 3]
    [1, 2, 3]

Moreover, because twice is a curried function, it can be partically applied with just one argument to build other useful functions. For example, a function that quadruples a number is given by twice (*2), and the fact that reversing, a (finite) list twice has no effect i captured by the equation twice reverse = id, where id is the identity function defined by x = x.

Formally speaking, a function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function as a result is called a *higher-order function.* In practice, however, because the term curried already exists for returning functions as results, the term higher-order is often just used for taking functions as arguments. It is this latter interpretation that is the subject of this chapter.

Using higher-order functions considerably increases the power of Haskell, by allowing common programming patterns to be encapsulated as functions within the language itself. More generally, higher-order functions can be used to define domain-specific languages within Haskell. For, example, in this chapter we present a simple language for processing lists, and in part II of the book we will develop languages for a range of other domains, including interactive programming, effectful programming, and building parsers.
